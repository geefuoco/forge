# Known issues and open delivery checks

## Upstream simulation can report failures as draws

Status: open upstream behavior, avoided by the evaluation design.

At the pinned upstream baseline, `SimulateMatch.simulateSingleMatch` catches `TimeoutException`, catches other exceptions and stack overflow, then calls `setGameOver(GameEndReason.Draw)` in `finally`. `Main.main` also ends command-line modes with `System.exit(0)`. The stock CLI therefore cannot provide the authoritative completion classification for our AI evaluation.

The separate evaluation runner must observe natural `Match.startGame` completion and its actual engine outcome. The supervisor owns timeout and crash classification. A forced cancellation must never gain a competitive winner or a natural-draw result.

## Hosted fork setup

Status: resolved by the user.

The user created [geefuoco/forge](https://github.com/geefuoco/forge). The GitHub connection confirms the repository and owner permissions. The local checkout retains full Card-Forge history, with the user fork as `origin` and Card-Forge as `upstream`. Local credential-manager enumeration was rejected earlier and was not used. No implementation has been pushed yet.

## AI quality requires decision review and human play

Status: unverified product requirement.

Successful builds, unit tests, and completed CPU games do not establish strong casual play. Review each requested commander's central decisions and obtain a human playtest before accepting the quality requirement. Record weak decisions with exact fixtures, settings, seed, and position evidence available from the engine.
